<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Postdoc at the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, working with [Prof. Hong-Ning Dai](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~henrydai/), [Prof. Byron Choi](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~bchoi/) and [Prof. William Kwok-Wai Cheung](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~william/).
I received my Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer and Data Science, Fuzhou University, in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Wenzhong Guo](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/4993.htm) and [Prof. Shiping Wang](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/8958.htm). Before that, I majored in software engineering and obtained my B.E. degree from the College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, in 2019. From Oct 2022 to Oct 2023, I was also a visiting researcher in Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, Austria, supervised by [Prof. Claudia Plant](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/59835/). My research interests include graph neural networks, optimization-inspired deep learning and their applications. My studies have led to over 20 scientific publications (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LM0QNdQAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>) on top-tier conferences and journals, including AAAI, IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMM, IEEE TSP, ACM TKDD, Information Fusion, Neural Networks, etc.
